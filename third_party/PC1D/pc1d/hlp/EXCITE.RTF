The excitation mode line can be set to Equilibrium, Steady State, or Transient. The choice determines the final state the solution will achieve before stopping. The solution will always proceed by solving first for Equilibrium, then Steady State, then Tra
nsient.
\par If the Mode is Transient, it 
is necessary to supply additional details for controlling the time dependence of the solution. The Step Size is the elapsed time between time steps. Setting this value too small may cause convergence problems. Large values (e.g. 1 second or more) can be u
sed to simulate the quasi-static response of the device to a swept excitation. Examples include current versus voltage and spectral response versus wavelength. The initial time step, which immediately precedes t=0, can be set to a different value from the
 r
emaining steps. Setting this value small permits the simulation of an abrupt change in excitation at time t=0. The entry for Number of Time Steps is the number of time steps of duration Time Step Size that are desired. The total duration of the transient 
will be the product of these two values.

\par }There are two identical Thevinin-equivalent source circuits; one associated with the base contact and on
e associated with the collector contact. Both circuits contain a voltage source and a series resistance. Different values of voltage and resistance can be specified for steady state versus transient conditions. Changing the voltage between its steady-stat
e and initial transient value causes a step change in voltage at t=0. Setting the final transient value different from the initial transient value causes the voltage to sweep linearly from the initial to the final value during the course of the transient 
solution.
\par The source series resistance affects how much current flows in the device for a given source voltage, but the loss associated with these elements is not reflected in the device performance as revealed in plots of collector or base current versus voltage. 
The value of series resistance can be specified either in ohms, or in ohm-cm. In the latter case, the series resistance is adjusted for each solution based on the area of the device being simulated.
\par A constant-voltage condition at a contact is achie
ved by setting the corresponding source series resistance to zero. A constant-current condition is maintained by setting both the source voltage and series resistance to large values, so that their ratio gives the desired current. The open- circuit voltag
e at either the collector or base contact can be obtained by setting the source voltage to a small (can be zero) value, and the corresponding resistance to a large value (1 megohm is usually plenty).
\par When a simple linear voltage ramp is not adequate, time-d
ependent source-voltage values can be supplied from an external ASCII data file having a filename with suffix VLT. Each line in the file should contain three numerical values, separated by one or spaces or by a tab. The first value on each line should be 
the time (in seconds), the second value is the source voltage (in volts), and the third value should be the series resistance (in ohms).The time values must be monotonically increasing. The maximum number of lines read from the file is 200. Note that the 
time values in this file do not affect the time steps used in the solution, which are determined by the {\uldb Mode}{\v HID_EXC_MODE} command. Rather, voltage values for each time step are interpolated from this file.

\par }The photogeneration options allow you to apply photoexcitation to the device, either as a photogeneration profile supplied via an external f
ile, or using one or both of two light sources which can illuminate either the front or rear surface of the device. 
\par When using the light sources, PC1D internally calculates the photogeneration rate within the device. At each incident wavelength, after accounting for incident-surface {\uldb reflection}{\v HID_REFLECTANCE_FRONT}
, the light is absorbed in the device using the {\uldb absorption coefficients}{\v HID_MATERIAL_INTRINSIC} for each region. If enabled, some light will be lost due to {\uldb free carrier absorption}{\v HID_MATERIAL_PARASITICS}. If the device has {\uldb 
texture}{\v HID_DEVICE_TEXTURE}
, then the photons do not travel parallel to the solution direction (x). The direction they travel makes a different angle with respect to x near the front surface than near the back. Both angles are calculated using the facet angle and the {\uldb 
index of refraction}{\v HID_DEVICE_MATERIAL_REFRACTIVEINDEX} for the material of region 1, with the transition between these two angles assumed to occur abruptly when x exceeds one-sixth of the facet depth. If the {\uldb internal reflectance}{\v 
HID_DEVICE_REFLECTANCE_INTERNAL}
 for the surface opposite the incident surface is non-zero, then some photons reflect from that surface with either the same angle at which they arrived (specular) or randomly-directed (diffuse). If the internal reflectance at the incident surface is non-
zero, then some of this reflected light gets trapped within the device until it eventually is either absorbed in the device or fails to be reflected from one surface of the other.

One photogeneration option is to supply an external ASCII file with suffix GEN that contains photogeneration information. This file should have two values on each line, separated by one or more spaces or by a tab. The first value is a position representin
g the distance of that location from the front surface, in {\f1 m}m. The second value is the cumulative photogeneration rate in the device between the front surface and that position, in carrier-pairs per second per square cm of projected
 area. Both the position and photogeneration values must be monotonically increasing functions within the file, and both must start with a value of 0.0 on the first line. Photogeneration information provided for positions beyond the rear surface of the de
vice are ignored. If the device is thicker than the last entry in the file, then no photogeneration is assumed beyond the last position defined in the file. {\b

\par }
These commands open a dialog box to examine or modify the magnitude and time dependence of light incident on the device, and to select whether the light is incident on the front or rear surface of the device. To use either of the illumination sources, you
 must first Enable that source from within this dialog box. Different values of illumination source intensity can be specified for steady state versus transient conditions. Changing the intensity between its steady-state and initial 
transient value causes a step change in intensity at t=0. Setting the final transient value different from the initial transient value causes the intensity to sweep linearly from the initial to the final value during the course of the transient solution. 
The values entered correspond to the total power density normally incident on the surface of the device, measured in W/cm2. One standard "terrestrial sun" corresponds to an intensity of 0.1 W/cm2. 
\par When a simple linear ramp of intensity is inadequate, time-
dependent light intensity values can be entered from an external ASCII data file having a filename suffix LGT. Each line in the file should contain two values, separated by one or more spaces or by a tab. The first is a time, in seconds. The second is an 
intensity value with units of W/cm2. The lines must have monotonically increasing time values. The maximum number of lines in the file is 200. The time values in this file do not affect the time step size or number of time steps used in the solution. Rath
er, an intensity value is interpolated from the LGT file for each point in time specified in the {\uldb Mode}{\v HID_EXC_MODE} command.

\par }The illumination spectrum choices are Monochrome, Black-Body, or External. 
\par The Monochrome option allows you to specify that all of the incident power occurs at a single wavelength. Different values of wavelength can be specified for steady state versus transient conditions. Changing the wavelength between its steady-state and in
itial transient value causes a step change in wavelength at t=0. Setting the final transient value different from the initial transient value causes the wavelength to sweep linearly from the initial to the final value during the course of the transient so
lution.
\par The Black-Body option allows you to invoke a black-body spectrum corresponding to a specified temperature. The spectrum is actually implemented as a group of discrete wavelengths, so you must declare the number of discrete wavelengths (maximum 200) and th
e range of wavelengths to include. You can artificially limit the wavelength range to simulate the effect of a filtered spectrum. The total power density in the black-body spectrum incident on the device is adjusted to match the values specified for {
\uldb illumination intensity}{\v HID_EXC_PRI_INTENSITY}. Note that for a given temperature, there is a limit to the intensity that can be obtained from a black body source; however, PC1D does not verify whether this limit has been exceeded.
\par The External option allows you to supply an external ASCII file that defines a spectral distribution, represented as a group of discrete wavelengths. These files have suffix SPC. Several important spectrums are provided with PC1D, including the air-mass 1
.5 direct and global ASTM sol
ar spectrums, and the extraterresrial solar spectrum. These files contain two values on each line, separated by one or more spaces or a tab. The first value is a wavelength in nm, and the second is a power density in W/cm2 (NOT spectral density, W/{\f1 m}
m/cm2). The entries must be in order of increasing wavelength, with a maximum of 200 wavelengths allowed The power densities are scaled as necessary so that the total light intensity for the spectrum as a whole equals the value specified for {\uldb 
illumination intensity}{\v HID_EXC_PRI_INTENSITY}.
