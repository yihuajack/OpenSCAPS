y
 in PC1D may be discontinuous between adjacent elements if there is an interface recombination velocity at a node, or if a circuit element (either external or internal) is connected at the node. In such cases, this graph will display the current densities
 
just to the left of the node; except at x=0, where the values shown are the current densities just to the right of that node. Note that at textured surfaces the total current density will not be uniform, because the cross-sectional area for current flow i

hown are the total integrated quantities from the front surface to each node in the device, including any recombination at that node. Thus, a non-zero value of Recombination at x=0 means that there is surface recombination at the front surface. This graph
 
is particularly useful for understanding where the recombination in the device is occurring, since the fraction of the total can be immediately observed by comparing the increase in the plot over a given region to the increase across the entire device. Th

This graph plots the mobilities of electrons and holes as a function of position. The solid line
 is for electrons, the dashed line for holes. When the variable-mobility model is used, the graph shows the resulting mobility for each carrier at each point based on the doping density at that point and the temperature of the device. Carrier diffusivitie

 valence-band edge, the dotted line is the electron quasi-Fermi energy, and the dot-dashed line is the hole quasi-Fermi energy. The zero of energy is taken as the equilibrium position of the Fermi energy, and positive energy refers to increasing electron 
energy (decreasing potential). The quasi-Fermi potentials (and hence energies) are defined at each node and thus are always continuous between adjacent elements. \cell }\pard \widctlpar\intbl\adjustright {\row }\pard \sa120\widctlpar\intbl\adjustright {
Carrier Velocities\cell This graph plots the average group velocity of electrons and holes as a fu
nction of position. The solid line is for electrons, the dashed line for holes. Positive velocity is toward the right, away from the front of the device. Current densities are proportional to the product of the velocity times the carrier density. The same
 conditions apply as described above for Current Density when there is a discontinuity in current at a node.\cell }\pard \widctlpar\intbl\adjustright {\row }\trowd \trgaph108\trleft-108 \clvertalt\cltxlrtb \cellx1560\clvertalt\cltxlrtb \cellx7371\pard

ty-carrier diffusivity times the minority-carrier lifetime, where the lifetime is equal to the excess minority-carrier density divided by the local bulk recombination rate. For equilibrium conditions this ratio would be undefined, so in that case the reco
mbination rate is calculated for a minority carrier density increased by 1% over the equilibrium value.\cell }\pard \widctlpar\intbl\adjustright {\row }\pard \widctlpar\adjustright {
